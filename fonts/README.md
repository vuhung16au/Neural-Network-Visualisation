To obtain the actual Roboto .typeface.json file for use in Three.js, follow these steps:

1. Go to the facetype.js generator:
https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/

2. Download the Roboto TTF font (if you don't already have it). You can get it from Google Fonts:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto

3. In the facetype.js tool:
  Click "Choose a font file" and select the Roboto-Regular.ttf file you downloaded.
  Wait for the tool to process the font.
  Click "Download typeface.json" to save the generated file.
  Rename the downloaded file to Roboto_Regular.typeface.json (if needed).

4. Place the file in your projectâ€™s fonts directory, replacing the placeholder.

After this, your Three.js code will use the real Roboto font for 3D text rendering. Let me know if you need step-by-step screenshots or further help!
